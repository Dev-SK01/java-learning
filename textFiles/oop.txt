----------------------- OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING ---------

1. class and object --> class ia blue print of object , object consist behavior. object stored in heap mem

2. Inheritance --> parent , child class , we can overwrite  the logic of the prent class object.
  single level and multi level inheritance. multiply inheritance no in java for that interface used.

3. className extends className , main method call last of the inherited class. 
   main method class should have public keyword.

4. POLYMORPHISM --> many form of the class method , method overloading,over Riding. 
   for using Polymorphism args must be different. method over riding works in inherited class.

5. ABSTRACTION --> hiding necessary things, in abstract class only method declaration defined.
  if we use without abstract word we can implement methods.
  we can implement method for abstract class in inherited class.
  but we need to implement all the methods in abstract class.
  we cannot able to create object for abstract class.

6. INTERFACE --> interface like astract , but diff if we cannot implement method in interface
   & need to implement all methods in interface.
   to inherit interface class implements keyword is used.
   we can implements multiple interface for one class. but in class inheritance it cannot.

7. THIS --> its an keyword for an current class object.

8. SUPER --> its an keyword for an parent class object.

9. constructor --> class name method is called constructor. when we create object for class
   constructor block executed. In default constructor created, used to creat an object.
   we can able to overload constructor.
